# Write a Python Program for t-test for the following problems and compute the result.
# 1. A random sample of 10 boys had the following IQâ€™s: 70, 120, 110, 101, 88, 83, 95, 98, 107 &
# 100. Does the data support the assumption of a population mean IQ of 100?

# o/p the assumption of a population mean 100 is wrong.
